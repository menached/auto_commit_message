# auto_commit_message
Generate a commit message after a save automatically

a program that will use openai to review my code and the latest change after a file save and come up with a good name for the changes that works as a git code commit message.   git add the file with the change and then use the message in a commit and push to the remote repo all in one go automatically behind the scenes.
